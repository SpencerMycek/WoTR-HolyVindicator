# Holy Vindicator

Mod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous


## Credits and Acknowledgement

Thanks to [Holic75][5], This was originally a part of [Call of the Wild][6], one of my favorite classes and mods from Pathfinder: Kingmaker

Thanks to [Truinto][1] author of [Dark Codex][2] for providing help, advice, and some methods so I could gain my own footing in C# and modding P:WoTR

Thanks to the entire OwlCat community discord and the modding community there, for answering my plethora of strange questions and pushing me in the right directions

Thanks to [Microsoftenator][3] who let me steal some code from a project of theirs: ExtraActivatableAbilityGroup [MicroWrath][4]


## Description

This mod does a few things with one major goal: Add the [Holy Vindicator][7] prestige class to Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
To do so, it unifies (somewhat) all of the channel energy features the player can acquire from leveling.

The end result is every channel energy feature being an ability with a sub-group of many variants, from Channel Smites, to lines and cones, and others. (I think the best way to preview the class is to read the linked Paizo SRD above)

## Known Issues
These are things I'm still trying to iron out, but I have gotten the archetype to nearly 100% of what it was in CoTW
- Angelfire Apostel does not 100% get all of the channel energy goods - In-progress
- Oracle and Inquisitor vindicators get 2 more levels of spells known than expected; Because they do not properly skip levels 5 and 9 for spellbook progression. - In-progress
- Still working on Divine Wrath/Judgement/Retribution - In-progress
